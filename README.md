# Question Extractor

Large language models can be instruction tuned with a set of questions and answers.
However, to further fine-tune a model *on your own data*, you need a large number of questions and answers which can be a lot of manual work.

This repository lets you use a non-fine-tuned language model and existing textual data to extract question/answer pairs automatically, eliminating all manual work.
